Javscript visualizer that reads from microphone input
Currently I use a windows loopback device to read in whatever audio is playing on my laptop. Getting this to work in a cross platform way isn't possible in JS.
Nodejs might be able to be used for this purpose, however the goal of this project currently is just for fun and getting back into the swing of javascript

How to use:
left and right arrow keys will select the current visualiation
up arrow key will pull up the menu, this is WIP and currently the only menu working is a prototype on the frequency bars visualization


TODO:

clean up the javascript
make the menu options object oriented so as to standardize the menu options and allow reuse across different visualizers
